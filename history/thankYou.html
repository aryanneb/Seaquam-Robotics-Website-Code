          <h5>Former Robotics Teacher and Mentor at Seaquam Secondary</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Mr. Hamade has provided extensive support to the Seaquam Robotics Program. Ever since the formation of
            Seaquam Robotics as the Seaquam Vex Competition Robotics Club, Mr. Hamade was there. He stayed after school
            for countless hours, helped new robotics students adjust to the program and even ran the Robotics course for
            robotics students. Through this substantial aid, the Seaquam Robotics program blossomed into the
            prosperous program it is today, and for that we thank you Mr. Hamade.</p>

          <p>Mr. Schellenberg has been with the Seaquam Robotics Program for many years. He diligently supervises
            students, while also aiding them in any design problems or questions that may arise thorough the process.
            His time at the shop has allowed the program to create more complex, competitive robots. For your time
            investment and aid in the shop, we thank you Mr. Schellenberg.
