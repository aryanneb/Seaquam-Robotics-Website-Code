        <div class="desc">
          <p>Mr. Hamade has provided extensive support to the Seaquam Robotics Program. Ever since the formation of
            Seaquam Robotics as the Seaquam Vex Competition Robotics Club, Mr. Hamade was there. He stayed after school
            for countless hours, helped new robotics students adjust to the program and even taught the Robotics course
            for robotics students. Through this substantial aid, the Seaquam Robotics program blossomed into the
            prosperous program it is today, and for that we thank you Mr. Hamade.</p>

          <p>Filling in the shoes of our previous Robotics teacher, Mr. Singbeil was added to our program two years ago.
            In that time, he has showed his dedication to the program. Whether we need help in our building or design,
            we know that Mr. Singbeil is there to help us through the entire process. It is incredible how he has
            handled the growth of the program and still managed to give everyone as much shop time as before
            to work on their robots. Thank you for your dedication to our program and the time you've spent making it
            great.

        <div class="desc">
          <p>The Delta School District has provided our program with the funding and space we require to be competitive.
            They have also allowed our program to be taken as a course in Seaquam, which allows students to focus on
            building competitive robots. Just a few years ago, this program only consisted of about twenty or so
            students in one class. From the support of the Delta School District, we were able to double this figure.
            For your extended support and faith in our program, we thank the Delta School District.</p>

          <p>Mr. Schellenberg has been with the Seaquam Robotics Program for many years. He diligently supervises
            students, while also aiding them in any design problems or questions that may arise thorough the process.
            His time at the shop has allowed the program to create more complex, competitive robots. For your time
            investment and aid in the shop, we thank you Mr. Schellenberg.

        <div class="desc">
          <p>As a former student himself, Owen knew exactly what it took to be competitive in Robotics. He volunteered a
            great deal of his time passing on this knowledge to the new Robotics students. He was also great at giving
            them advice with any of the machinery. His support aided teams at every competitive level and his
            knowledge about build quality rivalled even the best builders at Seaquam. This knowledge and skill combined
            with your dedication helped all teams in Seaquam, and for that we thank you.
