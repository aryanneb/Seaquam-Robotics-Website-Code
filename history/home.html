        <div class="hist-desc">
          <p>This game involved a lot of balls: big and small ones. Points are obtained when the different size balls
            are scored in the goal zones (canister looking things) or middle zones. This was Seaquam Robotics' first
            official participation in the VEX Robotics Competitions. Founding teams 9181A and 9181B competed in the BC
            Fall Qualifier. Initially named SVCRC, Seaquam VEX Competition Robotics Club laid the foundation for the
            amazing growth of this program.<br><br></p>
          <p>This year there were only two teams in the Seaquam Vex Competition Robotics Club, 9181A and 9181B.
            Interestingly, these teams were intially named the “Seabots” and “Team Dream” respectively, but this naming
            scheme was later abandoned.<br><br>

          <p>Skyrise was an interesting game. It involved stacking hollow cubes and owning posts. Points are scored by

            9181B competed in a total of 4 tournaments qualifying for the BC Provincial Championships. Striving for
            more, the
            Seaquam Robotics program formed 2 more teams: 9181C and 9181Z, who both successfully competed in qualifying
            tournaments.
            <br><br></p>
          <p>This year, Seaquam focused on building their foundational knowledge, a goal which involved learning more

      <div class="hist-content">
        <div class="hist-desc">
          <p>Ready, aim, fire! Nothing but Net was the first projectile VRC game for Seaquam. The rules of this game
            were relatively simple: shoot as many balls as possible into the net of your colour. 9181A, 9181B, 9181C and
            9181Z all competed. A new team, 9181D, was formed.>One of the most interesting aspect to this game was the
            robots elevating. Essentially, a team would have to
            lift the other robot up, which would score a significant (25 for low and 50 for high) amount of
            points. This made the game Nothing But Net extremely entertaining to watch, as it tested build quality while
            also allowing for competitive matches that were down to the wire.<br><br></p>
          <p>This was the also last year of Seaquam Robotics as an after=school club, as the Delta School district
            officially recognized Seaquam Robotics as an academic program instead of an after-school club.<br><br></p>

            <p>“This was the first year that Seaquam Robotics qualified for and attended the World Championships. 9181B,
              my team, had won the provincial championships after dethroning Gladstone Secondary – those who had held
              the provincial (and sometimes world) champion title for nearly a decade before us." <br>-

            <p>After qualifying for the World Championship, Seaquam was now seen as an international competitor in the

          <p>This year Seaquam also obtained a few notable sponsorships, stemming from the success of our team 9181B the

            <p><b>What made this season unique?</b></p>
            <p>The game this year was extremely different from any seen before. Previously, strategies mainly involved
              trying to score points for yourself. In this game, the strategies evolved to include tactical offense and
              defence, a component of this game which became vital in competitive play. That made this game much more
              different than any of the others, as it involved more critical thinking throughout the match duration.

            qualified for the BC Provincials. After a successful career of 4 years, one of Seaquam's founding teams,
            9181B, retires as the team graduates highschool.

            <p><b>Why was it hard for Seaquam to compete this year?</b></p>
            <p>The biggest problem was mainly funding. Other programs were able to charge the students for the products
              that they would end up buying, but in Seaquam we were limited by small class sizes and conservative
              funding towards our flourishing program.</p>

      <div class="hist-content">
        <div class="hist-desc">
          <p>Flip, shoot, king of the hill! During this season where it was a mix of projectiles and area control on the
            field, Seaquam had their most successful year yet. The program became bigger than ever with more people and
            community recognition. Biggest achievement yet was that Seaquam qualified more teams then they had
            officially registered for Provincials (which then involved borrowing a license plate from Shawnigan, RIP
            69991C)! Not only did Seaquam do exceptional qualifying for provincials, 3 teams qualified and competed at
            Worlds this season. A photo of teams 9181Y, 9181Z and 9181C playing cards with each other while waiting for
            their flight at worlds is depicted on the right, as well as the entire program on the bottom right.
            <br><br></p>
          <p>This year was also the introduction of the new V5 ecosystem. This change was difficult at first to adapt
            to, but in the end it became much more simpler to use compared to the old electronics. <br><br></p>

            <p>In the Robotics program we value safety. This year involved robust balls hurdling at high-impact
              velocities. To make sure there would be no damage to the window behind our field, our teacher tested the
              netting. The ball did not hit the window so we assumed it was safe. Somehow, the window still broke. <a

            <p><b> What milestones were achieved this season?</b></p>
            <p>"In turning point, we had 3 teams qualify for Worlds and I think 7 out of our 6 total teams qualify
              for provincials. This was a major increase compared to previous years and it led to our program doubling
              in size the next year." <br> - Aryan Neb, Current Member of Team 9181C </p>

          <p>This game was stacking, stacking and sometimes a little bit of scoring in towers. Cubes would be placed in
            stacks in the scoring zones, with cubes also being controlled in the towers, which multiplied the existing
            cubes in the goal zones. This game was much simpler compared to last year, where there were so many methods
            of scoring that it became confusing to score points for a game. <br><br></p>
          <p>For Seaquam, there were two main changes this season. Our teacher, Mr. Bryce Hamade, had to unfortunately
            step down from his position as his responsibilities as a father was increasing (he had twins!). This meant a
            new teacher, Mr. Lanz Singbeil was now the head of the Robotics program. Furthermore, the program
            effectively doubled in size, as there previous year's success and the continued support of our
            administrative staff allowed for a significant expansion to the program. A photo of a part of the program at
            Last Chance can be seen on the right. Unfortunately, this year was significantly effected by the COVID-19
            pandemic, which cancelled the World
