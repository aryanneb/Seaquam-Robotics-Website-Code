            <p>
              <br />Welcome to the top page of the Seaquam Design Database!
              <br />Please feel free to search up and navigate yourself through
              the menu on the left.
              <br />
              <br />
              This design resources page is designed to help teams who are newer
              to VEX, or for organizations and teachers who want to learn about
              the VEX design process.
              <br />
              <br />
              Firstly, the formatting of the notebook will be discussed, then
              the process by which design is conducted will be examined,
              analyzed and evaluated. Different Design Processes will also be
              introduced, as well as the core components which are universal.
              <br />
              <br />
              Then, the design rubric will be analyzed to see what judges are
              looking for and how students can achieve the highest possible
              points.
              <br />
              <br />
              Lastly, the presentation is briefly covered along with the
              significance of the notebook and design process in VEX.

            <h2>What You Need</h2>
            <p>
              <br />
              To get started with your design notebook, it is evident that you
              actually have a notebook. We at Seaquam Robotics recommend the
              original <a class="link">VEX Robotics Design book</a>, as it is
              generally all most teams will require. It only costs CA$14.99,
              making it a fairly priced notebook for the quality you get. The
              pages consist of dotted lines and spaces for dating, witnesses and
              even title headings.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is important to note that this notebook is not required. You
              can buy cheaper or more expensive notebooks, whichever is your
              preference. As a general rule, try to buy notebooks that have
              dotted patterns instead of lines, as it makes the drawing of
              accurate diagrams much easier. For those looking for the ultimate
              note-booking experience, <a class="link">Moleskine</a> notebooks
              provide excellent paper.
              <br />
              <br />
              As for the tool you use to write on the paper, Seaquam Robotics
              uses pens for the main bodies of text and pencils for complex
              diagrams or drawings. This is because patents require you to use
              pen so that they can verify the legitimacy of your drawings. This
              is a good habit to get used to in the future, as most design
              notebooks would be written in pen.

            <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
            <p>
              <br />The Table of Contents is one of the most important parts
              about any Design Notebook. It dictates to the reader the overall
              flow of your writing and allows them to quickly see the progress
              and organization of your thought processes.
              <br />
              <br />
              How does one create a good Table of Contents?
              <br />
              <br />
              There are three main components that go into creating a good table
              of contents entry: Page Number, Title and Date. In particular,
              creating a concise title can be difficult for most teams. For
              example, if my team had been working on our chassis that day, I
              would personally title that entry as "Chassis Development." This
              short title allows the reader to easily understand the message and
              meaning behind the entry entry without reading it. The other two
              components just make the document easier to find and verify.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another general design choice with the notebook is having an entry
              be only about two-three pages at maximum. Any entries longer than
              this should be separated into different entries instead, as the
              content being discussed is too much for one heading.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="two_2">
            <h2>Everyday Reflections</h2>
            <p>
              <br />Building on the idea of adding entries that are short and
              concise is the general practice of making entries everyday. This
              makes the design process more in-depth and thoughtfully
              considered. It also allows you to be more reflective about your
              own thought process after a long work session. In this case,
              'everyday reflections' refer to creating a reflection after each
              session you have where you work on your robot.
              <br />
              <br />
              At Seaquam, teams that are the most competitive make these
              reflections after each Robotics session, analyzing their choices
              and making goals for the future simultaneously.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are many methods which you can implement into your everyday
              Robotics work session to make this habit stick. Some teams may
              incentivize the notebook, offering someone write in it instead of
              having to clean up for their team after the session. At Seaquam,
              many students are given the 'designer' role so that they can
              fulfill the duties of creating the design notebook.
              <br />
              <br />
              Get creative with how you want your team to write daily in the
              notebook!

          <div class="two_3">
            <h2>Images, Drawings and CAD</h2>
            <p>
              <br />Showing what you are trying to build by creating visuals
              such as Images, Drawings, or Computer-Aided-Design (CAD), make it
              much easier for the person reading your notebook to better
              understand the topic you are elaborating on.
              <br />
              <br />
              Judges love additions of these visuals. For good reason, too! They
              make it much easier to see the thought process of the team.
              <br />
              <br />
              "I'm not good at drawing, does that mean I can't make the design
              book?"
              <br />
              <br />
              Not at all! Practice makes perfect, so the more designs you draw
              the better you will eventually get at it. If you want to forgo the
              drawings completely, CAD makes it much easier for even the worst
              artists to make realistic models. You can then print out
              screenshots of the CAD in multiple different angles, or even show
              the CAD to the judges itself.
              <br />
              <br />
              "How should I insert these visuals into my notebook"
              <br />
              <br />
              You can either draw them out by hand, or print them out then paste
              them in with glue or tape. Either of those methods is functional
              and will not dock you any points, making it the most
              time-effective solution.

            <h2>The Processes</h2>
            <p>
              <br />There are honestly a ton of different design processes that
              explain how we create solutions for problems in engineering and
              robotics.
              <br />
              <br />
              Most students are familiar with some variation of this one:
              <br />
              <br />
              <a class="link"
                >Define the Problem &#8594; Collect Information &#8594;
                Brainstorm and Analyze &#8594; Develop Solutions/Build a Model
                &#8594; Present your Ideas to Others for Feedback &#8594;
                Improve your Design and repeat the process.</a
              >
              <br />
              <br />
              One more straightforward examples is the NASA Engineering Design
              Process.
              <br />
              <br />
              <a class="link"
                >Ask &#8594; Imagine &#8594; Plan &#8594; Develop Create &#8594;
                Experiment &#8594; Improve and Repeat</a

              <br />
              <br />
              For any good design book, it is important you find a design
              process which you find easiest to connect to your teams build
              habits and and try using that one in your Notebook.
              <br />
              <br />
              After finding which one you like, make sure you are consistent
              with this process in your notebook. Each design choice you make
              should be explicitly connected to the process. This improves your
              knowledge of the processes and shows the Judges you understand the
              actions you are taking.

            <p>
              <br />If you have made anything, chances are you've subconsciously
              used a design process. Engineers find themselves constantly using
              these design processes, as they are creating new objects,
              structures, products even that require elegant and creative
              designs. The best way to improve your ability to create more
              efficient solutions to the problems at hand.
              <br />
              <br />
              The documentation of this process also for more in-depth critical
              thinking, as sometimes simply thinking about the problems can lead
              ot oversight or even inability to recognize future problems. The
              documentation process also makes it much easier to construct
              whatever it is that you are creating again.
              <br />
              <br />
              Those who are better at documenting this process can make their
              reflections and observations so clear and descriptive that anyone
              could replicate their creations, a goal that any Robotics students
              should strive to achieve.
