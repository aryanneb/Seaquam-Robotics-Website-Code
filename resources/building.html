            <br />Unlike our Coding and Design Book Resources Pages, we wanted to make our Building page more focused on
            our Youtube channel, which has extraordinary tips and resources for helping teams build competitive robots.
            These videos should give insightful and concrete feedback on how teams should build. Below each video will
            also be a quick summary of the main key takeaways.

          <h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">Key Takeaways</h4>
          <li>Use Aluminum C-Channel for a lighter, quicker robot.</li>
          <li>Use Steel C-Channel for a heavier, sturdier robot.</li>
          <li>Avoid cutting C-Channel, as you can't glue it back together. If you are, Have a clear plan of what, where
            and why you are cutting metal.</li>
          <li>Make sure that you mount the C-Channel correctly before cutting it.</li>
          <li>File sharp edges.</li>
          <li>Use Nylocks not Kept nuts on your final build.</li>
          <li>Avoid protruding axles.</li>
          <li>Lock axles with Shaft collars. Make sure these are tight on the flat side of the axle.</li>
          <li>Use Bearings whenever mounting an axle.</li>
          <li>Use a variety of different sized spacers to minimize total spacers used.</li>
          <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</li>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">Key Takeaways</h4>
          <li>A lift is used to manipulate game objects by moving the object up.</li>
          <li>A Four Bar Lift is great for new teams, as it is not complex and relatively easy to build.</li>
          <li>Since the four bar has to reach outwards, it does not have the highest reach vertically.</li>
          <li>A double reverse four bar is basically two four bars, allowing for extremely high reach.</li>
          <li>The double reverse four bar is also heavy, which means a higher center of gravity. This creates the
            perfect scenario for tipping.</li>
          <li>A double reverse four bar is also relatively hard to build.</li>
          <li>The scissor lift is great for lifting objects vertically, as it is more balanced than a double reverse
            four bar.</li>
          <li>The scissor lift is also extremely hard to build well, as a poorly built scissor lift can result in
            bending metal.</li>
          <li>Scissor lifts can also be great for wall-bats, which are robots that block other teams from scoring by
            physically creating a barrier.</li>
