            <br />Hi, and welcome! This page is for the new coders who starts their successful career now!
            <br />
            <br />The very first thing to do is to understand how programming works.
            <br />so, if you are brand-new to coding, go to <a href="https://code.org">code.org</a>, and learn the
            basics of coding.
            <br />
            <br />After that, or if you have some knowledge of coding already, let's get the coding softwares, or IDEs
            to start coding for VEX.
            <br />
            <br />You have several choices-
            <br />
            <br />1. <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode">VEXcode</a> - Easy-to-understand block coding for new
            coders.
            <br />2. <a
              href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-pro?___store=vexroboticsca&___from_store=vexrobotics">VEXcode
              Pro</a> - A Text-based coding using VEX C++ language, which is easy to understand and code.
            <br />3. <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu">PROS</a> - IDE based off ATOM IDE, for advanced coders using
            C++.
            <br />
            <br />In this coding resources website, we will focus on the info mainly on <span class="boldedText">VEXcode
              PRO</span> and <span class="boldedText">PROS</span>, which it is more complicated and likely to get
            confused.
            <br />

        <div class="two_2">
          <h1>Tutorials</h1>
          <h3>Setting Up Your IDE</h3>
          <p>
            <br />I will cover some steps on the setups on each of the IDE..
            <br />
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">VEXcode / VEXcode PRO</span>
            <br />1. Go to <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download">the download page</a>, select your OS
            and download the installer.
            <br />2. Once you have downloaded your installer, run it.
            <br />3. It will ask you for some license agreementss and access to some pc files.
            <br />4. After accepting, it will start to install the software.
            <br />5. Then, in middle of the installation, there will be an another pop-up that asks for your permission
            to install the drivers to your PC,
            which is required to properly recognize vex devices and compile programs.
            <br />6. After that is done, it should show up "InstallShield Wizard Completed", and see a shortcut on your
            Desktop.
            <br />7. You are done!
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">PROS</span>
            <br />1. Go to <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/">PROS Getting Started page</a>.
            <br />2. Once you are there, just follow their official instructions to complete the installation.

          <h3>What to do?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This page is for the begginers to understand what the coders need to do after setting all up.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">Coding your drive</span>
            <br />
            <br /><span class="-First of all, what is a drive?"></span>
            <br />Drive is a code for your robot to move and controlled by your VEX V5 Controller.
            <br />So in other words, you need to program your robot like a RC car so that the driver in your team can
            drive.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">-So what should I code?</span>
            <br />There are several different types of drive that you can code, and you need to ask your driver for
            their preference first.
            <br>
            <br />1.Tank drive
            <br />Tank drive is a drive where your left and right joystick on the controller moves each side of the
            robot.
            <br />For example, when you just tilt your right joystick, it will only move your right wheels/motors on the
            robot.
            <br />
            <br />2.Arcade Drive
            <br />Arcade drive is a drive where you have one joystick to do everything, from turning, curve and going
            straight.
            <br />
            <br />These are the two major types of drive if you use a normal chassis design, and a normal
            omnidirectional wheels on your robot.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">-How do I code this?</span>
            <br />There are example codes officially from VEX Robotics, you can find a "open examples" button from the
            "Files" tab on your VEXcode/VEXcode PRO IDE.
            <br />However, if you are missing some information, go to the <span class="boldedText">Useful
              Templates</span> page on each of the coding IDE you use.
            <br />
            <br /><button class="jump-button three-2">VEXcode Pro - Useful Templates</button>
            <br /><button class="jump-button four-2">PROS - Useful Templates</button>
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">Coding your Autonomous</span>
            <br />Coding your autonomous, whether if it is for the skills challenge or match, it goes through a same
            design process, personalized yourself.
            <br />Therefore, there is not really a correct form of doing it, different coders can have a different
            process.
            <br />Go check the <button class="jump-button five-2">Your Way Of Coding</button> page to learn how coders
            in Seaquam Robotics goes through their steps.

        <div class="three_1">
          <h1 class="smallHeadings">VEXcode Pro</h1>
          <h3>How to Code</h3>
          <p>
            <br />I will go over some basic steps for the new coders to VEXcode PRO.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">1. Create your project</span>
            <br />
            <br />What you first do when you code, you go to the <span class="boldedText">File > New</span> tab on the
            top-left navigation.
            <br />Name your project, and save to where you can easily access from your desktop.
            <br />I usually save it in a file folder directly created in the desktop.
            <br />
            <br />For competition programs, make sure you create a new project by selecting
            <br /><span class="boldedText">File > Open Examples... > Competition Template</span>.
            <br />This way, you don't need to worry about going through code inspections, unless you do something really
            wrong.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">2. Fonfigure your VEX devices</span>
            <br />
            <br />After you have created your program, now you want to configure your VEX devices, such as motors,
            controllers, and sensors if you use them.
            <br />
            <br />You click the icon which looks like a VEX Brain Port, located on the top-right.
            <br />Then, you click "add a device", and select the device you are going to use.
            <br />For controllers, you just click "Controller", and then "done" after.
            <br />For motors, you first select which VEX Brain Port you are using, then select "Normal" or "Reversed"
            corresponding to the direction the motor is facing.
            <br />Each sensors have a different set-up steps, but it is not hard.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">3. Code your basic functions</span>
            <br />
            <br />So, you are now finally ready to code.
            <br />First, it is strongly recommended to create any repetitive patterns of code made into functions.
            <br />
            <br />For examples, you can go check the <button class="jump-button three-2">VEXcode Pro - Useful
              Templates</button> page.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="boldedText">4. Code your drive/autonomous</span>
            <br />
            <br />After you created your functions, now you use them to code your drive and autonomous!
            <br />There are various things you can try out, but first, go check the <button
              class="jump-button five-2">Your Way Of Coding</button> page to learn how coders in Seaquam Robotics code
            their programs.
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="three_2">
          <h1 class="smallHeadings">VEXcode Pro</h1>
          <h3>Useful Templates</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This page will give examples on basic, useful functions that you can implement into your code!
            <br />
            <br />Set Velocity All function:
            <br />void setVeloAll(int leftMotorVelocity, int rightMotorVelocity) {
            <br /> LMtr.setVelocity(leftMotorVelocity,percent);
            <br /> LMtr2.setVelocity(leftMotorVelocity,percent);
            <br /> RMtr.setVelocity(rightMotorVelocity,percent);
            <br /> RMtr.setVelocity(rightMotorVelocity,percent);
            <br />}
            <br />This code sets velocity (speed) of the all four drive motors.
            <br />There are two parameters for the velocity; One for the left motors and one for othe right motors.
            <br />This way, you can use this for turning and spinning as well, aside from going back and forth.
            <br /> --------------
            <br />void stopAll(void) {
            <br /> LMtr.stop();
            <br /> LMtr2.stop();
            <br /> RMtr.stop();
            <br /> RMtr2.stop();
            <br />}
            <br />This code stops all of the drive motors. You will use this a lot, especially for the autonomous codes.
            <br /> --------------
            <br />void driveWithDeg(int leftMotorVelocity,int leftDeg,int rightMotorVelocity, int rightDeg) {
            <br /> setVeloAll(leftMotorVelocity, rightMotorVelocity);
            <br /> LMtr.startRotateFor(leftDeg, degrees);
            <br /> LMtr2.startRotateFor(leftDeg, degrees);
            <br /> RMtr.startRotateFor(rightDeg, degrees);
            <br /> RMtr2.startRotateFor(rightDeg, degrees);
            <br />}
            <br />This code uses setVeloAll(int, int); to set velocity for all motors, and then moves for the assigned
            degrees value.
            <br />This is also used a lot in the autonomous codes.
            <br />

          <p>
            <br />There is honestly not much to write here, since VEXcode Pro does not have any of the "snippets" and
            has very little stuff on the IDE itself.

            <br />Therefore, I will list down some pretty useful keyboard shortcuts for you to use.
            <br />F1 - Command Palette = You can type in what you want to do and it searches for you.
            <br />Ctrl + Shift + K = Deletes the whole line.
            <br />Shift + Alt + F = Formats your document.
            <br />Ctrl + Up = Zoom Out.
            <br />Ctrl + Down = Zoom In.
            <br />Ctrl + G = Jump to line.
            <br />Ctrl + / = Toggle line comment
            <br />Ctrl + Shift + Enter = Insert line on above (Your cursor stays on the same line, and shifts contents
            down).
            <br />Ctrl + S = Save.

          <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This section answers some frequently occuring coding problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br /> - My code shoots out errors!
            <br />Read the errors carefully. You might be missing a brace, bracket or a semicolon.
            <br />You might have wrong data type values in your functions.
            <br />
            <br /> - My robot does not go straight!
            <br />Are you using a time-based code? That makes the code inconsistent, making the robot move inaccurately.
            <br />Are your robot built straight? Hardware issues can affect your robot.

          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This goes through what is a Design Process for coding and its purpose.
            <br />
            <br />So, what is it?
            <br />Design process is a series of steps which you go through when you are trying to design and engineer
            anything.
            <br />This applies to coding too. Your speed and quality of coding will bump up when you have this.
            <br />
            <br />There are different models from various places and I will encourage you to dive in and search for the
            one that best fits you.
            <br />
            <br />Generally and usually, the design process has sections for planning, testing, trying and improving the
            item, and each of these are divided smaller in different models.
            <br />You will go through these process to ensure you are productive and it tells you what to do like a
            manual.
            <br />
            <br />Establishing a good desing process means you are having a way better productivity and performance as a
            coder.
            <br />So find your way of coding, check out some different styles created by big corporations and some
            awesome engineers.

          <h3>Your Way Of Coding</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This section will provide some example of a coding process, followed by the actual Seaquam Robotics
            Coder.
            <br />
            <br />Process of Ryu Sado - 9181C
            <br />
            <br />I usually tend to follow some very simple and short design process that is easy to follow and very
            fast to move on.
            <br />
            <br />There are four steps:
            <br />1.Plan&Analyze - You make your general plan as you collect information on what would be effective and
            efficient.
            <br />2.Test&Teardown - You tear down your general plan into very small sections, like a single function,
            and then test them to perfection.
            <br />3.Trying&Refining - You merge all the small sections you created at step 2, and then you will go
            through the whole thing until you don't find any flaws.
            <br />4.Cut-off&Improve - Your step 3 continues until your due date (tournament day) comes. After the
            tournament, you will take the result and give ideas and plans for better improvement.
            <br />
            <br />This design process was very successful for me, since I had established this process in my first year
            of VEX EDR robotics, and I managed to go to the worlds championship through the skills challenge.
            <br />
            <br />I hope this fits you too!

          <h3>Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This page explains what documentations are for.
            <br />
            <br />There are several reasons:
            <br />1. You find your past mistake.
            <br />Human memories are not that reliable - therefore, it is better to note what you tried, and failed so
            that when you try it again,
            <br />you do not need to repeat the same mistake.
            <br />
            <br />2. Good for presentation.
            <br />It is way better to have a big log of your work to show to the judges, rather than just showing a line
            of code in your laptop.
            <br />It gives them the better idea of what you have worked on, and your design process.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />3. You find your ancient code
            <br />You can quickly find how to code your awesome code that worked 3 tournaments ago. You might be able to
            re-use and re-cycle your brain power from the past!
