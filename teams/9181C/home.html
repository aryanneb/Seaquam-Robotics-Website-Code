          <p> I'm a grade 12 student at Seaquam, currently in my third year in the robotics program. Designing and
            building is my passion, so joining this program was a no-brainer for me. My goals in robotics are to improve
            my build quality and design process, as well as using my experiences to help teach new students. Some of my
            passions include swimming, fishing, and gaming. </p>

          <h3> Programmer </h3>
          <p> Ryu is a grade 11 student from Japan who has been dedicated in programming and building robots after
            experiencing being in a robot juku (private academy) from grade 6. Heâ€™s been working and competing in FLL
            robotics competition for Mindstorm EV3 robot kit. Back in Japan, he learned English from foreign teachers
            and curriculums. His school was a Canadian International School, so he decided to use his English and learn
            something more while visiting Canada. He found this robotics course program at Seaquam, Ryu decided to learn
            robotics here. </p>

          <p> It is really entertaining and exciting to see robots compete every year. I joined the robotics program in
            grade 10 after I volunteered to help in the provincial tournament when I was in grade 9. The robots in the
            tournament were gigantic and the autonomous was absolutely phenomenal and remarkable, which really motivated
            me to join the program. Once I started participating in Robotics, I found another avenue to express my
            creative and competitive nature. </p>

              a first year team this was an incredible achievement, and we knew we had to carry over this energy. Our
              next year we competed in Tower Takeover, where we were able to improve our design process, as well as our
