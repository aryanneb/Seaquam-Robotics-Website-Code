            As the programmer for 9181S, I have engaged in discovering new and innovative ways to design and program
            software. I am passionate about STEM subjects and I strive to pass knowledge and enthusiasm to others as
            well. Our camaraderie has always made this program one of my most admired community, and I hope to be hope
            to be able to build and maintain this prestige.

          <p>
            After four years in the Seaquam Robotics Program, I created the robotics team, 9181S in hopes to mentor
            younger students while learning from each other as teammates. In the past, I have volunteered by helping the
            robotics club at Science World as well as judging for STEM competitions around the lower mainland. Recently,
            I was invited to be a member of the REC Foundation Student Advisory Board alongside twelve members from
            across the world.

            Anisha has been apart of Seaquam Robotics for 3 years. She joined in grade 9 and has stayed in the
            program ever since. She does 9181S's design and documentation. Anisha spends time drawing the robot and is
            also a third set of hands for building the robot. She has a strong team to help her with her ideas and
            balances out design options. Outside of school, she is an instructor for the UBC Geering Up program and
            helps teach kids about engineering.She also attends SFU Girl Powered camps to be taught about conquering the
            engineering fields in university.

              Our first season was Tower Takeover as 9181S. We started off the season slowly until we won our first
              award at the second tournament at Walnut Grove. We won judges for our flip-out deployment. Next at
              Shawinigan Lake, we won the tournament championship and excellence. In January we attended Port Moody and
              won tournament finalists and judges. In February we then hosted the Seaquam tournament and won the Amaze
              Award. At provincials, we got Tournament Finalist, Skills Championship and the Think Award. This was our
              first season as 9181S.
