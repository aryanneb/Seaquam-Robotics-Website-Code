              We have 3 members on our team who are all in grade 11, one of us is in their 4th year, one in their 3rd,
              and the last member is in their first year. Finding what to modify or add onto the robot is always
              discussed and thought out. This year 9181W strives to have fun and perform excellently in competitions
              as we are intending to do retain our title of B.C. Mainland Regional
              Champions.

            Julian took an important role in Seaquam Robotics History. Julian influenced new robotics students
            while also making amazing innovations that influenced many teams. Julian also was a role model for
            all robotics students, as he followed rules and took inititive whenever the opportunity presented
            itself. This drive allowed him and his team to accomplish great things.

              9181W has been in the program for one full year but we were previously known as 69991C Shawkbots. Using
              that license plate, they made it to provincials as first years. Particularily in Seaquam, this started
              trending as a sort of meme.
              This was the year that we at Seaquam actaully had more team plates qualifying for provincials than the
              actual teams registered. This meant that
              the then 9181W took the 69991C licence place from the Shawnigan Robotics Program. Nowadays, 69991C is
              forever a team that signifies Seaquam Robotics Excellence and goes to show how dedicated some teams are to
              attending provincials.
